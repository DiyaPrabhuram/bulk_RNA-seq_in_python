# Bulk RNA-seq Analysis in Python
This repository contains all the basic information one needs to conduct bulk RNA-seq analysis in python.

# Basic Differential Expression Analysis
Differential expression analysis is a technique used to idenitfy genes with significant expression profile differences between two or more samples. ( https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/auto_examples/plot_minimal_pydeseq2_pipeline.html )

# Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
GSEA is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes). ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp )
